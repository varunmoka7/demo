# Methodology for Carbon Emission Calculation (PRL-Greenko Report)

## 1. Data Sources
- **Trip Data:** PRL-GreenkoReport-24-25.csv (trip-wise details: vehicle, distance, etc.)
- **Vehicle Data:** PRLGreenko.vahans.csv (vehicle type, fuel, technical specs)
- **Emission Factor References:**
  - "India Specific Road Transport Emission Factors 2015" (WRI emission factors.pdf)
  - Land-Transport-Guidance.pdf (SBTi Transport Guidance)
  - SBT-transport-guidance-Final.pdf (Science-Based Targets Initiative)
  - Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework

## 2. Distance Measurement Logic

### 2.1 Distance Data Source
- **Primary Source:** "Total Distance" field from PRL-GreenkoReport-24-25.csv
- **Measurement Method:** GPS-tracked distance during actual trips
- **Data Range:** 226.45 km (shortest) to 1607.72 km (longest trip)
- **Average Distance:** 1,140 km per trip

### 2.2 Distance Validation
Cross-verified against:
- Route planning software estimates
- Driver logbooks
- Vehicle tracking system data

## 3. Emission Factor Derivation

### 3.1 Primary Reference: WRI India Specific Road Transport Emission Factors (2015)

**Source Document:** "India Specific Road Transport Emission Factors 2015" - WRI emission factors.pdf ([WRI India GHG Program, 2015, Table: Sr.No Category kg CO₂/km, Page 32](PDF/WRI%20emission%20factors.pdf))

**Specific Values from Page 32:**
- **LDV (<3.5T):** 0.307 kg CO₂/km
- **MDV (<12T):** 0.5928 kg CO₂/km  
- **HDV (>12T):** 0.7375 kg CO₂/km

*Reference: WRI India GHG Program, 2015, Table: Sr.No Category kg CO₂/km, Page 32*

### 3.2 Applied Emission Factor Selection

**Methodology for Factor Selection:**
1. **Vehicle Classification:** Cross-referenced registration numbers between datasets
2. **Weight Category Analysis:** 
   - HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) → HDV (>12T) → **0.7375 kg CO₂/km**
   - LGV (Light Goods Vehicle) → LDV (<3.5T) → **0.307 kg CO₂/km**
   - MGV (Medium Goods Vehicle) → MDV (<12T) → **0.5928 kg CO₂/km**
   
*Reference: WRI India GHG Program, 2015, Table: Sr.No Category kg CO₂/km, Page 32*

3. **Fuel Type Verification:** All vehicles confirmed as diesel-powered

### 3.3 Applied Emission Factors (Updated, CO₂e)

**Updated Logic:**
- Emission factors are applied based on vehicle category, using WRI India 2015 values with a 10% uplift for real-world conditions (traffic, terrain, etc.).
- The 10% uplift is a general factor recommended by the GLEC Framework ([GLEC Framework, Smart Freight Centre, 2019, Section 4.2.2](https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/how-to-implement-glec-framework/glec-framework/)), and is also supported by SBTi guidance ([SBT-transport-guidance-Final.pdf, Section 4.3](PDF/SBT-transport-guidance-Final.pdf)) to account for average real-world inefficiencies not captured in standardized emission factors.
- Defining specific uplift factors for each trip would require highly granular data (e.g., precise idling times, road grade variations, specific traffic conditions encountered per trip), which is beyond the scope of the current data and methodology. The 10% serves as a standardized proxy.
- Factors are reported as **CO₂e (CO₂-equivalent)**, not just CO₂, to account for all greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) as per WRI and GLEC guidance.
- No return trip or load factor adjustment is made, as all trips are one-way and load data is not available.

| Vehicle Type | WRI Base Factor (kg CO₂/km) | Uplifted Factor (kg CO₂/km) | Citation |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| LGV (<3.5T)  | 0.307                       | 0.34                        | WRI India, 2015, p.32 |
| MGV (3.5-12T)| 0.5928                      | 0.65                        | WRI India, 2015, p.32 |
| HGV (>12T)   | 0.7375                      | 0.81                        | WRI India, 2015, p.32 |

**Assignment:**
- LGV: 0.34 kg CO₂e/km
- MGV: 0.65 kg CO₂e/km
- HGV: 0.81 kg CO₂e/km

**Why uplift?**
- The 10% uplift accounts for real-world inefficiencies (traffic, terrain, idling, etc.) as recommended in the GLEC Framework ([GLEC Framework, Smart Freight Centre, 2019, Section 4.2.2](https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/how-to-implement-glec-framework/glec-framework/)) and SBTi guidance ([SBT-transport-guidance-Final.pdf, Section 4.3](PDF/SBT-transport-guidance-Final.pdf)).
- The WRI and GLEC factors are already reported as CO₂e (including CH₄ and N₂O from diesel combustion), so no further GWP conversion is needed.

**GHG breakdown and GWP values:**
- CH₄ and N₂O emission factors are included as per WRI India and IPCC AR5 ([IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/)), with GWP values: CH₄ = 28, N₂O = 265.
- All CO₂e calculations use these GWP values for full compliance with international standards.

**Distance for Calculation:**
- Use the 'Running Distance' (actual distance covered by the vehicle, as per GPS/odometer) for all emission calculations.
- 'Total Distance' (map/planned) is used only for benchmarking route efficiency.

**No return trip or empty run adjustment is included.**

## 4. Calculation Methodology (Updated)

### Step 1: Data Integration
- Match vehicle registration numbers between trip and vehicle databases
- Extract running distance, vehicle type, and fuel type for each trip

### Step 2: Emission Factor Assignment
- Assign vehicle-specific emission factor (see table above) based on vehicle category

### Step 3: Emission Calculation
**Formula:** Emissions (kg CO₂e) = Running Distance (km) × Vehicle-Specific Emission Factor (kg CO₂e/km)

### Step 4: Route Efficiency Benchmarking
- Calculate route efficiency as: Route Efficiency = Running Distance / Total Distance
- Use this metric to identify trips with significant detours or inefficiencies

### Step 5: Quality Assurance
- Cross-verification with vehicle manufacturer specifications
- Comparison with international logistics benchmarks
- Sensitivity analysis with alternative emission factors

- Running Distance: 1,504.59 km
- Vehicle: NL01G7634 (HGV, Diesel)
- Emission Factor: 0.81 kg CO₂e/km
- Calculation: 1,504.59 × 0.81 = **1,219 kg CO₂e**

### Trip A-T-DOD-A7934 (Shortest Trip):
- Running Distance: 75.09 km  
- Vehicle: AP02TB0748 (MGV, Diesel)
- Emission Factor: 0.65 kg CO₂e/km
- Calculation: 75.09 × 0.65 = **48.81 kg CO₂e**

### Route Efficiency Example:
- Total Distance: 1,607.72 km
- Running Distance: 1,504.59 km
- Route Efficiency: 1,504.59 / 1,607.72 = 0.936
